# SQL

There is SQLalchemy ORM and also the SQLalchemy core

There are tables and rows
inside a db there are tables and inside the tables there are rows

Coloums are the attributs and one row is simply one set of data record or attributes

## every row in a table needs to have an unique identifer i.e that is the the `primary key`.

## So `primary key` basically tells us that it has to be unique and cannot be nullz

Different datatypes:

A feild can be:
int, char(fixed_size), varchar(max_size), text, enum("c++","java","python"), double, float, decimal(decimal_places), boolean, date, time, datetime, timestamp

```plaintext
